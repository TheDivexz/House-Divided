 news.1.t:0 "Cotton is King"
 news.1.d:0 "On March 4, 1858, James H. Hammond of South Carolina delivered his infamous \"Cotton is King\" Speech in where he claimed that \"England would topple headlong and carry the whole civilized world with her, save the South. No, you dare not make war on cotton. No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is king.\". And to protect this cash crop, Hammond coined the term \"Mudsill Theory". This theory states that \" In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life. That is, a class requiring but a low order of intellect and but little skill.\" or in simpler terms, There must always be a lower class for the upper class and, \" Fortunately for the South, she found a race adapted to that purpose to her hand. A race inferior to her own, but eminently qualified in temper, in vigor, in docility, in capacity to stand the climate, to answer all her purposes. We use them for our purpose, and call them slaves\"."

 news.3.t:0 "House Divided"
 news.3.d:0 "A house divided against itself, cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become lawful in all the States, old as well as new — North as well as South."
